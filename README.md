# ionic-stylus
Port of Ionic Framework (http://ionicframework.com/) SASS (http://sass-lang.com/) files to Stylus (https://learnboost.github.io/stylus/)

Translated with http://sass2stylus.com/ and some manual work. _items.styl needs some more attention and the url values in _ionicons-font.styl should be made dynamic.

All files prefixed with underscore, so they are ignored by the preprocessor and can be imported as needed in main stylus file.
